# Papercuts

Format: date · symptom · fix · project. Check here first when tooling is slow or fails mysteriously.

- 2026-09-23 · A fresh task checkout had no `node_modules`; offline pnpm install missed cached
  tarballs and sandboxed registry requests failed DNS resolution, then focused Vitest could not
  import `ToolchainIntegrity.generated.js` · Run the lockfile install with approved network access
  and `pnpm --filter @silklang/compiler toolchain:generate` before focused checks · compiler

- 2026-09-23 · A delegated worktree had only a partial `node_modules`; `pnpm exec` automatically
  attempted a full install and stalled on unavailable npm registry DNS · Stop the retry, use the
  prepared main checkout's dependency links and binaries for focused checks, and pass Vitest
  `--configLoader runner` to avoid writes through a read-only dependency link · compiler

- 2026-09-19 · Ran the whole `packages/compiler` vitest suite (about 230 files, 25–40 min locally;
  each `ModuleVerification` shard alone is about 10 min) after every change and as the harness for
  a temporary probe, which cost hours · Typecheck, then run only the test files that exercise the
  change (`CI=true ../../node_modules/.bin/vitest run test/A.test.ts test/B.test.ts`); to learn
  which files matter, grep the tests or run a probe once and keep the list of files it flagged. Run
  the full suite once per milestone and on CI, which shards it four ways and is faster than a
  laptop · compiler
- 2026-09-19 · A full run left going in the background while editing mixed old and new code,
  because each worker loads whatever is on disk when its file starts, so the result proved nothing
  · Never edit under a running suite; stop it first · compiler
- 2026-09-19 · `pkill -f "vitest run"` left worker processes alive that kept writing output ·
  `pkill -f vitest`, then check `ps aux | grep -c "[v]itest"` is 0 · compiler
- 2026-09-19 · `ScannerDeterminism`, `ConditionalConformanceDeterminism` and the `StdlibResolution`
  byte-identity test fail with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `dist/*.js`; `lsp`/`docgen`/`cli` tests
  fail to resolve `@silklang/*` · Build first:
  `CI=true node scripts/turbo.mjs run build --filter=@silklang/lsp...` · compiler, lsp
- 2026-09-19 · Three `ModuleVerification` cases fail locally with "Missing planned place" ·
  Identical on `main` locally and green on CI; not a regression, do not chase · compiler
- 2026-09-20 · `pnpm --filter @silklang/compiler exec tsx -e` could not load compiler sources
  because the workspace LLVM package did not expose `@silklang/llvm/ByteString` · Use focused
  Vitest fixtures, which build workspace dependencies correctly, for runtime inspection · silk
- 2026-09-20 · Documentation checking hit Node's 4 GB heap after the first target profile because
  the async loop retained the previous whole-project analysis frame · Isolate each profile analysis
  in a helper so only its detached documentation model survives the iteration · compiler
- 2026-09-20 · Running `pnpm --filter` in a detached comparison worktree with symlinked
  `node_modules` tried to replace the modules directory and aborted without a TTY · Invoke the
  primary worktree's `node_modules/.bin/vitest` directly from the comparison package directory ·
  compiler
- 2026-09-21 · The `silk-work` workflow's `superset mcp` transport was unavailable on PATH while
  claiming JUL-209 · Use the connected Linear MCP tools directly and preserve the same admission,
  evidence and reread gates · silk
- 2026-09-21 · Compiler typecheck produced hundreds of misleading missing `@silklang/llvm/*`
  errors in a fresh worktree · Build `@silklang/llvm` once before the focused compiler typecheck ·
  compiler
- 2026-09-21 · Native CLI tests failed with `Unknown attribute kind (102)` because `/usr/bin/clang`
  17 could not read LLVM 22 bitcode · Run native CLI checks with
  `PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH` so the compiler and Clang use the same LLVM generation ·
  cli
- 2026-09-21 · An effect test that locally provided a service failed native emission with an
  unresolved downstream `completeTest` continuation, matching the open generic bracket-runner
  defect · Exercise the closed Effect from a normal test until that separate compiler change lands
  · compiler
- 2026-09-21 · Local `pnpm release:candidate` could not install offline consumers because the pnpm
  metadata mirror lacked unrelated package records · Use exact CI for the full release-candidate
  gate; locally verify that changed export assertions advance past manifest validation · repository
- 2026-09-21 · A zsh test wrapper assigned to the readonly `status` parameter after the test had
  already run · Use a task-specific exit variable or avoid capturing the status when inspecting a
  redirected log · repository
- 2026-09-21 · A temporary comparison-worktree command was rejected because it began with
  `rm -rf` cleanup · Use a unique temporary path and add the worktree directly · repository
- 2026-09-22 · Indexing the current Superset workspace with codebase-memory failed because a
  pre-coordination or unverified generation was active · Inspect the worker log to confirm the
  guard, leave the unrelated indexer alone, and use direct read-only source inspection · silk
- 2026-09-22 · Vitest tried to bundle a temporary config beneath a read-only dependency symlink and
  failed with `EPERM` in `node_modules/.vite-temp` · Pass `--configLoader runner` when using a
  workspace-local temporary Vitest config · cli
- 2026-09-22 · The compiler documentation check could not start in a focused workspace because
  `@silklang/docgen` had neither its workspace dependencies nor a complete build · Run the check in
  a prepared checkout with the docgen dependency graph built first · compiler, docs
- 2026-09-22 · A fresh codebase-memory index for the task worktree refused to start because a
  pre-coordination or unverified CBM generation was active · Reuse the indexed main Silk checkout
  for structural discovery and use targeted filesystem inspection only for uncovered task-local or
  ignored files · repository
- 2026-09-22 · A `cd` into a temporary probe project reset the shell cwd, and every following
  `pnpm exec silk` call failed with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before running · Keep the shell in the
  repository root and address probe projects only through `--manifest-path` · repository
- 2026-09-22 · A large union failed to parse with a misleading `Expected }` at an unrelated later
  variant because one field was named after the contextual keyword `role`; keyword fields such as
  `type` and `unsafe` reported clearly, but `role` did not · Check a new field name against the
  `TokenKind` keyword list before debugging the enclosing declaration · compiler
- 2026-09-22 · A lowering test asserted zero generic parameters because its fixture source named the
  function `run`, a keyword; the parser recovered the whole signature into a flat run of `Error`
  nodes, so the failure surfaced as a wrong count far from the cause rather than as a syntax error ·
  Dump a new fixture with `silk-compiler <file>` before asserting against it, and check fixture
  identifiers against the `TokenKind` keyword list · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · Starting an authorized merge in a linked worktree failed because the sandbox could
  not create the shared Git worktree's `ORIG_HEAD.lock` · Retry the exact scoped merge with approved
  Git metadata access instead of changing branches or bypassing the worktree · repository
- 2026-09-23 · A focused formatter/linter command used repository-root paths after changing its cwd
  to `packages/compiler`, so formatting matched no files and the package-local binary path was
  wrong · Keep the repository root as cwd for root-relative file lists and tool binaries · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · `pnpm exec silk` in a worktree ran the _main checkout's_ CLI: the globally installed
  `silk` shim execs a hard-coded `/Users/.../Documents/dev.nosync/silk/packages/cli/dist/bin.js`, so
  a compiler fix committed only in the worktree was invisible and `silk test` reproduced a bootstrap
  blowup the worktree had already fixed; every self-hosted figure taken this way is a measurement of
  the wrong compiler · Build locally with
  `CI=true node scripts/turbo.mjs run build --filter=@silklang/cli --filter=@silklang/compiler`, then
  run `node packages/cli/dist/bin.js <check|test|build> --manifest-path compiler/silk.toml`, and
  state which binary produced any self-hosted figure · repository
- 2026-09-23 · A bare `{ ... }` block inside a function body is not a nested block: the grammar reads
  the brace as a nominal record literal, so a shadowing fixture silently became a
  `StructLiteralExpression` with a missing type · Use a construct that owns its block (`if true { }`,
  `while`, `unsafe`) when a fixture needs a nested scope · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · `silk format --manifest-path compiler/silk.toml` reformatted every reachable source
  file, not just the ones the task touched, so a task diff suddenly contained unrelated parser and
  HIR churn; reverting it with `git checkout --` then also discarded the task's own edits to the
  same files · Do not run the project formatter on a task branch; if it is run, restore the
  unrelated files individually and re-apply the task edits from the change set · repository
- 2026-09-23 · `match value { true => ..., false => ... }` on a `bool` is `SEM0044 Match does not
cover bool` plus a parse error on each arm: `true` and `false` are not patterns, so the arms read
  as binding identifiers · Use an `if` with a `mut` local; `match` is for unions and enums only ·
  compiler
- 2026-09-23 · A Codex model that works from the shell fails through Intent delegation with
  `invalid params: Could not apply Codex model 'gpt-6-sol': JSON-RPC error -32602`, because two
  different Codex clients are involved: the shell CLI is `codex-cli 0.156.1` at
  `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`, while Intent routes through the ChatGPT desktop app's embedded
  `Codex Framework.framework` (`client_version: 0.153.4` in `~/.codex/models_cache.json`), and the
  backend serves that older client a model list omitting newly released slugs, so Intent rejects the
  model before it reaches the API; delegation also returns `ok: true` and fails only after the agent
  starts, so an unsupported slug looks like a successful delegation · Update the ChatGPT desktop app
  (`npm install -g @openai/codex@latest` upgrades a binary Intent never invokes), and pass effort as
  the separate `reasoningEffort` argument (`sol-high` is not a model name) · repository
- 2026-09-23 · `pnpm --filter ... exec vitest` tried to reinstall and purge the existing dependency
  tree in a non-TTY session, aborting before a focused test could run · Invoke the already-installed
  `node_modules/.bin/vitest` directly for focused compiler checks · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · Native acceptance reached `ArtifactCache.set` but failed with `EPERM` because its
  default cache writes under `~/.cache`, outside this worktree's writable sandbox · Set
  `SILK_NATIVE_CACHE_DIR` to a dedicated directory under `/private/tmp` for local tests · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · A focused native test reported an ownership error at a source offset that did not
  match the current `format.silk`; the compiler loaded an older embedded copy from
  `Stdlib.generated.ts` · Run `node scripts/generate-stdlib.mjs` in `packages/compiler` after
  editing stdlib Silk before interpreting diagnostic offsets or runtime results · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · Documentation generation passed policy checks but silently omitted newly registered
  stdlib pages because `generate-documentation.mjs` read the built compiler's older manifest · Run
  `node_modules/.bin/tsc -p packages/compiler/tsconfig.json` after changing the manifest, then
  regenerate documentation and check that the new pages exist · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · A fresh silk worktree has no `node_modules`, and after `pnpm install` the compiler
  test files still fail to import: first `Cannot find module './ToolchainIntegrity.generated.js'`,
  then `Cannot find package '@silklang/llvm/ByteString'` · Run `CI=true pnpm install` with
  `--frozen-lockfile`, then run all three generator scripts from `packages/compiler`
  (`generate-unicode-tables.mjs`, `generate-stdlib.mjs`, `generate-toolchain-integrity.mjs`), then
  build the LLVM package with `turbo run build --filter @silklang/llvm` · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · `MirVerification` emits the same `InvalidCallableOperation` rule tag for both the
  `MakeCallable` and the `ApplyCallable` blocks, so a violation report alone does not say which
  operation failed and sends debugging to the wrong code · Read the violation's `detail` string,
  not the `rule`: "callable construction disagrees ..." is `MakeCallable`, "callable application
  disagrees ..." is `ApplyCallable` · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · Focused Vitest matched an untracked `.pnpm-store/v11/projects` duplicate of the
  compiler suite and failed after the intended JSON case passed · Exclude `.pnpm-store/**` from
  focused Vitest runs until the store is outside test discovery · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · `pnpm lint` aborted before reading any source with "The `options.denyWarnings` option
  is only supported in the root config", failing `validate` CI and the docs preview; the culprit was
  a generated `.oxlintrc.json` under the git-tracked `.pnpm-store/` cache, not the root config ·
  Gitignore and untrack `/.pnpm-store/` (`275516ad`); on any oxlint _configuration_ error, search for
  stray `.oxlintrc.json` under cache or vendored directories first · repository
- 2026-09-23 · `ws.git.commit` silently restaged an ignored cache file that had just been removed
  from the index, so the commit still contained it · Use `git rm --cached` plus `git commit --amend`,
  and verify with `git status` after any commit that removes a path from the index · repository
- 2026-09-23 · The fresh-snapshot determinism canary timed out at 30s after stdlib growth, with no
  indication whether cost or output changed · A focused run passed all assertions in 86.4s with a
  120s limit; its three full snapshots scale with the stdlib's 167 modules · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · In a shared checkout, a peer's `ws.git.commit({files: [...]})` naming `corpus.ts`
  staged the WHOLE file, sweeping ~180 lines of my uncommitted work in that same file into their
  task-scoped commit; separately my `format.silk` was reverted to base in the working tree and had
  to be recovered · An explicit `files` allowlist stages whole files, never just your own hunks, so
  two agents with uncommitted edits in one file cannot both commit cleanly. Keep an out-of-tree
  copy (`cp x /tmp/x.mine`) before running anything that touches shared state, and commit your own
  scope the moment it passes instead of batching it behind further verification · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · A fresh `intent` worktree had no `node_modules`, so both the workspace and the
  primary checkout's `vitest` failed to resolve `effect` · Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in
  the worktree once; the symlink trick from the older papercut does not resolve workspace packages
  · repository
- 2026-09-23 · Blamed a failing `StdlibResolution` closure assertion on a peer's concurrent edit by
  reverting only my own file and seeing it still fail; the real cause was a list already stale at
  the base commit, and reverting one of two concurrent changes never tests a clean base · To
  attribute a failure in a shared checkout, check out the BASE commit's inputs, `rm -rf
packages/compiler/dist`, and rebuild with `turbo run build --force` (a plain build hits the
  cache); and verify the causal chain you are claiming rather than concluding by elimination —
  `option.silk` has no imports, so the chain I asserted could not have existed · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · Reported a branch as "pushed at HEAD" after a co-agent committed to the same shared
  checkout; their commit was local only, so the reported head did not contain the fix it was
  credited with, and a conflicted PR meant no CI existed to expose the gap · In a shared checkout
  never infer push state from your own last push: check `git rev-list --left-right --count
HEAD...@{u}` before reporting a head, and confirm each claimed deliverable against `origin/<branch>`
  with `git show origin/<branch>:<path>` rather than the working tree · repository
- 2026-09-23 · Checking `.git/MERGE_HEAD` in a worktree falsely suggested that merge state had
  disappeared, because `.git` is a pointer file there · Resolve the Git directory with
  `git rev-parse --git-dir`, or check the state directly with `git rev-parse --verify MERGE_HEAD`
  · repository
- 2026-09-23 · `pnpm --filter @silklang/compiler exec vitest` tried to purge `node_modules`
  during a dependency-status check and aborted without a TTY before the focused test began · Run
  `../../node_modules/.bin/vitest` from `packages/compiler` when dependencies are already present
  · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · Compiler test shards 3 and 4 each carried 57 files, yet ran 10m21s and 20m46s;
  shard 4 timed out eight tests · File count is a poor cost proxy: keep per-test timing artifacts
  and rebalance the shards using measured work · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · The delegated worktree had no `node_modules`; offline pnpm install lacked cached Changesets packages and online install retried unreachable npm DNS · Reuse the prepared main checkout's dependency links for focused local compiler checks · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · Codebase memory refused to index this Intent worktree because an unverified generation held its coordination lock · Use the existing indexed Silk checkout to locate symbols, then verify source in the active worktree · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · A Turbo compiler build invoked pnpm's dependency repair, retried unreachable registry URLs, and recreated `node_modules` after a successful install · Restore dependencies with `CI=true pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then run the needed generator, focused Vitest files, and direct `tsc` checks · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · `git restore` could not create this Intent worktree's Git index lock under the read-only linked Git directory · For a generated file changed only by this session, restore its exact committed bytes with `git show HEAD:<path> > <path>` · repository
- 2026-09-23 · The focused native JSON corpus case failed at `NativeToolchain.ArtifactCache.set` using the default in-memory cache, before program execution · Set `SILK_NATIVE_CACHE_DIR` to a writable `/tmp` directory for that focused run; the same case passed · compiler
- 2026-09-23 · A filtered `pnpm exec vitest list` probe unexpectedly started recreating root
  `node_modules`, then registry DNS failures left `.bin` missing · Stop the install, move the
  incomplete directory aside, link the prepared main checkout's `node_modules`, and invoke its
  binaries directly for focused local checks · compiler CI
- 2026-09-23 · The codebase-memory index worker refused this worktree because another generation
  was active, so graph discovery could not start · Inspect its log, then use targeted source reads
  for the workflow and report script until indexing is available · compiler CI
- 2026-09-23 · Focused Oxlint on script paths passed, but CI's full type-aware lint found floating
  Node test promises and direct process environment reads · Await Node test registrations, pass
  the GitHub summary path as an argument, and verify against full-root lint when dependencies are
  complete · compiler CI
- 2026-09-23 · After the interrupted install was cleaned up, worktree Oxlint could not resolve its
  preset, while main-checkout Oxlint treated the worktree config as a nested root config · Confirm
  both lockfiles and Oxlint configs match, then lint the changed absolute paths from the prepared
  checkout with `--disable-nested-config` · compiler CI
- 2026-09-24 · `rtk vitest --version` produced no output and stalled during a focused merge check ·
  Stop that probe and invoke the prepared `node_modules/.bin/vitest` directly · compiler
- 2026-09-24 · Focused TOML tests appeared to ignore recent Silk source edits because the compiler reads generated embedded stdlib text · Run `node packages/compiler/scripts/generate-stdlib.mjs` after each stdlib edit before testing · compiler
- 2026-09-24 · `pnpm exec vitest` in the TOML task worktree retried unreachable registry downloads and left only a partial `node_modules` · Stop the repair, link the prepared main checkout dependencies, and invoke its Vitest binary directly · compiler
