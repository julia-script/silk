# Silk prescriptive language reference

This directory is the prescriptive programmer-facing reference for Silk's language rules. It states
the intended language behavior against which the compiler, standard library, tests, and other
documentation are reconciled. It is assembled during language stabilization from author decisions,
OpenSpec requirements, tests, and compiler behavior.

## Audience

The primary reader is a programmer writing Silk who knows general programming concepts but does not
know Silk compiler internals. Familiarity with Rust, Effect, or Effect TypeScript may help, but is
not assumed.

Language and compiler contributors are a secondary audience. Evidence links connect each rule to
the detailed artifacts used to verify or reconcile it.

## Authority during stabilization

Each rule carries one status:

- **Confirmed** — the language author has explicitly confirmed the intended programmer-visible
  behavior during stabilization.
- **Candidate** — existing decisions, specifications, tests, and implementation support one
  coherent rule, but the author has not yet confirmed it.
- **Disputed** — authoritative-looking artifacts disagree or the implementation contradicts the
  intended rule.
- **Unsupported** — the boundary is deliberate and programmer-visible.
- **Unresolved** — no coherent rule has been selected.

Confirmed rules prescribe intended Silk semantics but do not create a compatibility promise before
1.0. Candidate, disputed, and unresolved rules mark the exact places where the prescription is not
yet final. Existing OpenSpec requirements and tests remain trace evidence; stabilization work must
reconcile them with confirmed rules rather than silently preserving a contradiction.

## Reference shape

Every rule uses the same compact structure:

1. **Status**
2. **Rule** — one programmer-visible statement
3. **Example** — the smallest useful valid program or fragment
4. **Boundary** — the nearest program that is invalid or behaves differently
5. **Diagnostics** — the source error required at an invalid boundary. Rules that only define valid
   behavior say that no diagnostic applies.
6. **Evidence** — decisions, specifications, tests, and known implementation mismatches

A required diagnostic describes the language contract independently from the current compiler. It
states the invalid condition, the offending source location, and the information the error must
communicate. A stable diagnostic code is recorded when one exists; an unassigned code remains
explicit rather than borrowing an unrelated current code. Exact message wording belongs to the
generated diagnostic catalog, not to the language rule.

Defining intended semantics comes before a systematic implementation audit. A current compiler
mismatch is recorded when stabilization work encounters one, but discovering every mismatch is not
a prerequisite for confirming a language rule.

Compiler representations such as HIR, MIR, generated runners, layouts, and backend instructions do
not belong in a language rule unless a program can observe them.

Every domain in the initial stabilization map now has a reference page. Individual pages continue
