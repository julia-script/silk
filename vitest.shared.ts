 * stops extending it.

/**
 * Vitest's default is 5 s, which is a budget for a test that does arithmetic, not for one that
 * drives a compiler. Two of the flaky-CI issues on this repo (#147, #173) were a test whose real
 * cost was well inside 5 s locally and outside it on a loaded shared runner: `packages/compiler-cli`
 * measured an amplification of ~57x between an idle machine and a contended one, and
 * `packages/lsp`'s slowest test runs 2.3 s locally, which needs only a 2.2x amplification to be
 * reported as a timeout rather than as a result.
 *
 * The floor is 60 s because 30 s was measured to be too low, not because 60 is a round number.
 * `pnpm check` saturates the runner end to end — the compiler suite alone is ~2,580 s of test CPU
 * on a 4-core host — and at that saturation the slowest tests in `packages/compiler` legitimately
 * run 30–38 s: `StackVmPressureDeterminism` 37.6 s, `ModuleVerification` 31.4 s,
 * `LexerPressureDeterminism` 30.3 s. Those pass only because each carries an explicit timeout;
 * `ChildProcess.test.ts > lowers the native execution to reachable native-only runtime symbols`
 * carries none, inherited a 30 s floor, and was reported as a timeout on CI. A floor a test in the
 * workspace already exceeds is not a floor. 60 s also matches the value `packages/compiler-cli`
 * arrived at independently from its own measurement.
 *
 * This is not a performance gate and nothing here asserts how fast anything is. It exists so that
 * a correctness assertion is never reported as a timeout. The cost of raising it is that a test
 * that genuinely hangs takes a minute to say so, which is the trade `packages/compiler-cli` had
 * already accepted for the same reason.

 *
 * Vitest's own default is already derived from the host — `availableParallelism() - 1` — and the
 * subtracted core is not an accident. It leaves something for the OS, the Turbo and pnpm
 * supervisors, and the I/O a test does outside its worker. An earlier revision of this file set
 * every package to the full core count and CI got worse, not better: `packages/compiler-cli` had
 * been running on vitest's default, the override took its spare core away, and its watcher test —
 * which asserts that a 200-file non-atomic write burst is never read mid-truncate, and so depends
 * on its own writer being schedulable — started failing (#177).
 *
 * What has to be bounded is how many suites run at once, and that is `scripts/concurrency.mjs`.
 * How many workers one suite uses is vitest's business, and vitest already scales it with the host.
