 * The static search index, and the matcher the rendered pages run over it.
 *
 * The index is data, not a search engine: each entry names a declaration and where to find it, and
 * the ranking lives in `query` below. A prebuilt inverted index or a scoring model would freeze a
 * retrieval decision into a build artifact that the site cannot change without regenerating every
 * page, and at roughly a thousand declarations a linear scan in the browser is not the bottleneck.
 *
 * `query` is also the function the pages themselves run — `script` serializes this exact function
 * into the page rather than restating it — so a test that exercises the matcher is exercising what
 * the site does, not a copy of it that can drift.
