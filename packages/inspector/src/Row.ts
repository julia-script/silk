/**
 * The one row every inspector is built from.
 *
 * Each phase used to render its own card markup, so comparing two phases meant reading two
 * different visual languages and scrolling six times as far. A shared row makes the phases
 * genuinely comparable: the same construct occupies the same shape everywhere, and the only
 * thing that differs between panes is the content of the columns.
 *
 * Rows are pure data — no callbacks, no host objects — so a projected view survives structured
 * serialization unchanged. Activation is the consumer's job: a row is activatable exactly when it
 * carries a span, and what activation *does* (move a cursor atom, reveal a range in an editor)
 * belongs to whichever surface renders the row.
