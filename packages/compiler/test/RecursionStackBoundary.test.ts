/**
 * Ordinary recursion is bounded by the machine stack, deliberately: the compiler adds no shadow
 * stack and no per-call allocation, so a call costs a call. These tests pin the *shape* of that
 * boundary rather than the depth at which it arrives — the depth belongs to the host's stack size,
 * the optimizer's frame layout, and the engine, and asserting one would only manufacture flakes.
 *
 * What is pinned:
 *
 * - a shallow chain traverses on all three engines and releases every link exactly once,
 * - a deep chain fails on every engine, each in that engine's own way, and
 * - the escape hatch — an explicit iterative teardown — carries a chain far beyond the depth at
 *   which the recursive form dies.
 *
 * The measured native bounds are evidence rather than language contract; tests assert only the
 * selected stack policy and observable native termination behavior.

/**
 * A singly linked chain of boxed nodes, with three phases that can be measured apart:
 *
 * - `build` is iterative, so construction never contributes call depth and a failure is always
 *   attributable to the phase under test,
 * - `stepDepth`/`viewDepth` is the ordinary recursive walk, borrowing one level at a time, and
 * - `drain` is the explicit iterative teardown: it unlinks one level per loop turn, so the chain
 *   is already flat by the time automatic cleanup sees it.
 *
 * `Intrinsic.replace` is what makes both loops expressible. A local cannot be partially moved out
 * of and a `match` arm is an expression rather than a statement, so a loop that walks ownership
 * down a chain has to swap a sentinel into the place it takes from.
