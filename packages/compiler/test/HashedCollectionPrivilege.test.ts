/**
 * No engine contains a hash operation.
 *
 * `HashMap` is ordinary library source over `Allocator` and typed storage, and every hash a program
 * computes is a call to a function some witness declared in Silk. That is a constraint on the
 * compiler rather than on the collections, so it is checked where a violation would appear: in the
 * catalogue of operations the compiler provides, and in the MIR of a program that really uses a map.
 *
 * The catalogue check is the wider of the two. An engine can only gain a primitive by an intrinsic
 * being declared, and semantic analysis, HIR, MIR, and LLVM lowering all draw from that one
 * catalogue — so a catalogue with no hash in it is several
 * statements at once, and it would fail on the first commit that added one anywhere.
