 * `never` to that type is legal — it inhabits every type — and both contracts then name the same
 * machine. Only the side carrying `never` is widened, and every other channel still has to be
 * exactly equal, so this never relates two contracts that differ in what they actually produce.

 * matched against the contract a caller or a declared result asks of it.
