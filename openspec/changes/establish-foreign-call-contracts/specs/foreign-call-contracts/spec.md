## Purpose

Define immediate native call behavior, unsafe optimization assertions, complete-call pointer loans and deterministic termination when a foreign exception crosses the Silk boundary.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Foreign calls carry an explicit conservative behavioral contract

Every foreign declaration SHALL carry normalized memory, locality, capture, borrow, returned-alias, return and forbidden-unwind facts. An omitted property clause SHALL mean external read/write memory, possible pointer capture, no borrowed parameters, no returned-alias assertion and normal return. Source MAY narrow those facts only through `with Intrinsic.foreign(...)` on an unsafe foreign declaration. The admitted literal fields SHALL be memory (`none`, `read`, `write`, `readwrite`), locality (`external`, `arguments`), noCapture and borrow (tuples of parameter names), returned (one parameter name) and noReturn (Boolean). Unknown or duplicate properties, wrong literal kinds, nonexistent parameters and invalid type/contract combinations SHALL diagnose at their source spans. Parameter sets SHALL normalize by ordinal; property order and renamed local parameters SHALL NOT alter behavioral identity. Explicit permitted unwind and retained or callback lifetime properties SHALL be rejected.

#### Scenario: Preserve an unannotated declaration

- **WHEN** a source declaration provides no behavior clause
- **THEN** semantic, executable and emitted contracts remain conservative and contain no optimistic memory, capture, returned-alias or no-return assertions

#### Scenario: Validate unsafe assertions

- **WHEN** source names a non-pointer parameter in noCapture, a raw pointer in borrow, a duplicate field, a nonexistent parameter or returned together with noCapture on that parameter
- **THEN** analysis rejects the declaration with the offending code/span and preserves declaration origins

### Requirement: Immediate borrowed C parameters retain ordinary complete-call obligations

A single-value `&T` or `&mut T` parameter SHALL be admitted as a C pointer only when named by borrow. This unsafe assertion SHALL promise no capture and no freeing for the complete call. The caller SHALL retain ordinary initialized-state, shared/exclusive access, aliasing, liveness and cleanup obligations through the entire call. Slices and reference results SHALL remain unadmitted. Raw pointers SHALL remain non-owning; noCapture SHALL NOT create a loan, preserve an owner, imply nofree or initialize output storage. Returned aliases SHALL require an identical raw-pointer result type and SHALL NOT confer ownership.

#### Scenario: Borrow for one call

- **WHEN** a checked initialized local is passed by an admitted reference parameter
- **THEN** its loan covers all argument evaluation and the call, conflicts with overlapping incompatible arguments, and ends after the call

#### Scenario: Reject capture-capable reference parameters

- **WHEN** a foreign declaration accepts a reference without the borrow promise or a caller borrows uninitialized or incompatibly loaned storage
- **THEN** analysis rejects the declaration or call without manufacturing raw-pointer lifetime guarantees

### Requirement: Native optimization preserves declared memory behavior and error reads

Only explicit admitted assertions SHALL justify narrowed memory/locality, capture, returned or no-return attributes. Default calls SHALL preserve externally observable operation/accessor/read ordering and visibility of foreign writes. Error-accessor spelling SHALL have no compiler significance. An explicit noReturn declaration SHALL have a unit result and no successful continuation. Ordinary loads SHALL NOT become globally volatile and ordering SHALL NOT require a hardware fence.

#### Scenario: Read renamed native error state

- **WHEN** an ordinary fixture operation changes native state and an immediately following renamed accessor exposes it for a read
- **THEN** debug and optimized native executions observe the operation's state, and an intervening deliberate state change produces the correspondingly different result

#### Scenario: Emit only asserted properties

- **WHEN** separately declared functions assert read-only, argument-local, no-capture, returned-alias or no-return behavior
- **THEN** structural native output reflects precisely those admitted facts and conservative neighbors keep their required memory effects

### Requirement: Visible behavioral contracts participate in native identity

Normalized behavioral contracts SHALL enter semantic surfaces, executable/MIR inventories, native interfaces and affected cache identities. Visible declarations with the same native symbol and machine signature but different behavioral contracts SHALL diagnose a mismatch relating both origins. Equivalent contracts SHALL agree. Cross-unit validation SHALL compare supplied interface records without claiming to infer unavailable behavior from arbitrary object code. Unsupported LTO requests SHALL reject explicitly.

#### Scenario: Detect equal machine types with different promises

- **WHEN** two visible declarations or supplied native interfaces assign incompatible behavior to one symbol
- **THEN** the compiler rejects the mismatch even though their C parameter/result classes agree

#### Scenario: Invalidate behavior changes

- **WHEN** a selected declaration changes only its admitted behavior clause
- **THEN** its semantic/native interface identity changes and incompatible cached results are not reused

### Requirement: A foreign unwind terminates at the Silk boundary

Foreign exception propagation SHALL be forbidden. When an admitted native platform unwinder reaches a Silk foreign-call boundary, execution SHALL take the compiler fatal-trap outcome before any enclosing foreign caller can catch the exception across Silk. A bare no-unwind optimizer promise SHALL NOT substitute for this behavior. Normal calls SHALL preserve their C results and memory effects. This contract SHALL NOT promise support for nonlocal jumps that bypass the platform exception unwinder.

#### Scenario: Throw toward a foreign catch above Silk

- **WHEN** a separately compiled C++ fixture calls an exported Silk function inside a catch and a foreign function invoked by Silk throws
- **THEN** Darwin ARM64 and GNU/Linux x86-64 and ARM64 debug/optimized executions terminate at the Silk boundary and do not reach the enclosing catch

#### Scenario: Require concrete native evidence

- **WHEN** the designated boundary verification lanes run
- **THEN** they compile, link, inspect and execute the admitted fixtures with pinned supplies and fail when required supplies or fixtures are missing
