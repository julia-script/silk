## Nominal qualification requires an inherent member

CALL-003 and STYLE-002 require a nominal-qualified function to be published in that type's
inherent `impl`. A top-level function whose first parameter is that type is not an inherent
member. Operator mappings follow the same ordinary lookup rule (OP-009).

The TypeScript bootstrap currently accepts the old `operator-interface-contract` fixture's
`Vector.scale` and `Vector.dot` mappings even though those functions were top-level declarations.
The native acceptance job in [run 36627847695](https://github.com/julia-script/silk/actions/runs/36627847695)
confirmed that acceptance. The self-hosted frontend correctly rejects those unpublished members.
The fixture now declares both functions in `impl Vector`, retaining its expected result of 42.
The bootstrap is frozen during backend development; retire this entry when it enforces the
same owner lookup rule.
